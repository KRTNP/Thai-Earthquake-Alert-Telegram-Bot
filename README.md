A real-time monitoring system that tracks earthquake events from the Thai Meteorological Department (TMD) website and delivers instant notifications via Telegram.

## Features

- Automatically scrapes earthquake data from TMD website
- Sends immediate Telegram notifications for new earthquake events
- Configurable magnitude threshold for alerts
- Includes comprehensive earthquake details (magnitude, location, depth, coordinates)
- Supports both Thai and English location information
- Special visual indicators for felt earthquakes
- Detailed logging system
- Customizable monitoring intervals

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Telegram bot token (from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather))
- Telegram chat ID

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
